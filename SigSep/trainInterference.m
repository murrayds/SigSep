    % This function trains a model representing the interference of a signal by using one
    % of several algorithms. The algorithms are defined as:
    % 
    %  - A supervised algorithm where by we train models for both the target and interference. The 
    %     interference will be trained by using a signal containing only the sound labeled as interference.
    %
    %   - A semi-supervised algorithm designated as "semi" where by the model for the interference is trained 
    %     direct from a mixture containing the target sound. In this case the target must have already been 
    %     trained. The already trained target models are not altered. 
    %
    %   - Another semi-supervised algorithm designated as "prior" which acts in exactly the same way as the 'semi'
    %     algorithm except that the previously trained target models will be altered. 
    %
    % Inputs:
    %   obj     : The SigSep object this function is being called on
    %   signal  : Either a time series signal or an already processed spectrogram representing
    %             either a mixture signal or training data depending on the algorithm
    %   alg     : Either a character array or an integer denoting which algorithm to use
    %               1: 'known'    - Train interference using training data
    %               2: 'fixed'    - Train interference using a mixture, target model is fixed
    %               3: 'unfixed'  - Train interference using mixture, target model may be altered (Not implemented yet)
    %   maxitr  : Training the interference uses an iterative algorithm. maxitr defines the maximum 
    %             number of iterations to be calculated
    % Oututs:
    %   obj     : A version of the SigSep object passed into the function with interference data updated
