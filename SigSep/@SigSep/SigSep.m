	% SigSep(K, FFTSIZE) 
	%
	% SigSep stands for SignalSeparater. This class implements algorithms detailed by Paris Smaragdis in
	% order to separate mixtures into two signals: One being the "Target" and the other being the "Interference".
	% In order to do this one may train a model for both the target and the interference of a signal and use these
	% two known models as criteria to separate a novel mixture. One may also only train only the "Target" and then
	% have the interference be representative of everything else. 
	%
	% To use this class one must first train the model representing the target and the interference. Simply call
	% the method "trainTarget()" and pass in the appropriate information to train a model for the target. There 
	% are two current methods to train the interference. If the method being used is classified as semi-supervised
	% or unsupervised then the target Must have already been trained first. 
	%
	% After the target and interference models have been trained, simply call the method "separate" in order to 
	% separate a mixture.
	%
	% An example of workflow using this class is as follows:
	%
	%  >> S = SigSep(10, 2048);     			%instantiate the class
	%  >> [t1 fs] = wavread('sound1.wav')		%load first sound
	%  >> t2 = wavread('sound2.wav')			%load second sound
	%  >> mixutre = S.createMixture(t1, t2) 	%create a mixture from the two sound files
	%  >> S = S.trainTarget(t1)					%train target with default number of max iterations
	%  >> S = S.trainInterference(t2, 'known') 	%train the interference using a completely supervised algorithm
	%  >> [s1 s2] = S.separate(mixture, 200, 'on') %separate the mixture with plotting of results on
	%  >> sound(s1, fs)							%listen to resulting time series to ensure it worked.
	%
	% It is also worth noting that "target" and "Intergerence" are relative terms. Target may also be trained using
	% the background noise of a signal/ For example: If given a recording of a woman talking with birds in the background,
	% the target may be trained on either the birds or the voice, and the interference can be trained on the mixture. 
	% It is perhaps easier to think of our Target as what we know, ie: what we have training data for.
    %
	% In order for the class to function correctly, ensure that the sampling rate on each provided signal is
	% identical. It is also worth noting that the more training data provided and components specified, the 
	% more accurate the results are likely to be. The drawback is computational time.
